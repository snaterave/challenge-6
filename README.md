## Overview

### The challenge

This Testimonials grid section project, I tackled the challenge of crafting a visually appealing and functionally preview card using TAILWINDCSS, at the same time, adapting this to a responsive desing using the fundaments of first mobile design.  This challenge allowed me to explore fundamental concepts of design and layout, while also strengthening my TAILWINDCSS and CSS skills within a practical context.
